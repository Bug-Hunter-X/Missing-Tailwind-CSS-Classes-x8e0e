# Missing Tailwind CSS Classes

This repository demonstrates a common error in Tailwind CSS: forgetting to include required classes.

The `bug.js` file shows an example where the `text-gray-800` class is missing, resulting in unexpected styling. The `bugSolution.js` file shows the corrected code.

This is a simple example, but it highlights how easily errors can occur when working with Tailwind's utility-first approach. Careful attention to detail and thorough testing are essential to avoid these types of mistakes.
